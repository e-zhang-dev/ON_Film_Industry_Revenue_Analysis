# Ontario Film Dashboard

## **Project Background:**<br/>
Ontario releases publically accessible statistics on the filming industry revenue and tax credit. In this project I am extracting insights and making recommendations to improve revenue from filming segments.<br/>

## **Executive Summary:** <br/>
-	Television Series revenue hit a record $2522M and project growth up an average 7%. Foreign project tend to have higher value, while domestic projects have high volume. Continued investment into the domestic market and services will keep revenues high, and increase competitiveness for new foreign projects.
-	Feature Film revenue is up an 83% since pandemic. Although slower new project growth (5.6%) and struggling per project revenue caused total revenue share to drop 6% since 2012.  Increased revenues remain challenging as domestic new project fell 10% post-pandemic. There is reinforcement by an increase in foreign projects (+63%) and increasing per project revenue. Further service investments and incentives are recommended to bolster domestic markets and increase project growth.
-	Television Movies & Co. (TV Movies, Short series, Pilot) is up an average 17% and leads new project growth at an average 9.9%. It is high volume but low in value segment. Earnings are dictated by a strong domestic market, with 88% of new projects being domestic in 2022. 
-	OFTTC tax credit is in a financially strong position. Both Television Series and Feature Film provide high margin returns. Margins are thin for Television movies & co., but are sustainable with fortification by high project count television series. <br/>

- Television Series domestic revenue only grew 9% to $892M despite new project growth due to limited average revenue growth.

## **Recommendations:**<br/>

Increasing new project growth of feature films.<br/>
  -	Grow domestic appetite for local feature films. <br/>
      -	Grow sales channels for domestic movies, as to increase visibility and profitability of local feature films. <br/>
      
Attracting foreign new projects.<br/>
  -	Build out services that improve foreign outreach.
      - Invest in services that compliment potential strategic partnership with foreign firms. Helps facilitate more foreign awareness and knowledge transfer.<br/>
      
Explore why ARPU for Television Movies & Co. is low.<br/>
  -	Further explore individual composition of Television Movies & Co. 
      -	Track how pilot television episodes pipeline is affecting revenue, and what the conversion rate to full series is?<br/>
      
Increase domestic project growth for Television series.<br/>
  -	Continue OFTTC Tax Credit.
    -	It helps subsidize a portion of the service cost for new pilot project, securing a strong domestic TV pilot -> series pipeline. This will consequently improve revenue by seeding for the higher margin segment.
    -	Also preserves talent in province, which makes it competitive for foreign projects.<br/>
    
## **Questions**
-	[Type_of_Production]
    -	Why is there a large revenue disparity so between television sections?<br/>
    - Is there a complimentary relationship between ‘Television Movies, Short Series, pilot’ and “Television Series’?<br/> 
- [Type_of_Production] and [Domestic_or_Foreign]
    -	How do production segments compare by origin?<br/>

## **Assumptions:** <br/> 
- Television Movies and Co. is comprised of many different sub industries within the television industry.
    - Earning will vary from one to another, where short film may produce more revenue than pilot programs. <br/>
- Revenue composition from Ontario collected from incentives and services.
    -	This category is largely generalized, and does not go into detail on what services or incentives are at play <br/>
-	Tax credit revenue and its direct ties to production have been simplified. I.e. in 2022, 299 productions were certified vs. the 300 total domestic productions.
    -	As direct analysis is only for general performance against revenue, we will make an estimated cost against all projects per market.<br/>
